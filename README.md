## ðŸ“˜ About the Repository  

This repository includes brief reports on:  
- **Sorting_Algorithms (!) :** A detailed analysis of 6-7 sorting algorithms, covering their implementations, advantages, disadvantages, and time complexities.  
- **Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm:** Comprehensive documentation of Strassen's algorithm, its code, analysis, and its significance in matrix multiplication.  

The content is structured to provide both theoretical insights and practical examples of algorithmic design and efficiency.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights  

### **Included Files**  
1. **`Sorting_Algorithms(1).pdf`:**  
   - Covers sorting techniques such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and others.  
   - Includes pseudo-code, advantages, disadvantages, and complexity analysis (best, average, worst cases).  
   - A comparative analysis of the algorithms is also provided.  

2. **`Strassen Matrix Algorithm Analysis.pdf`:**  
   - Explains the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication.  
   - Discusses the algorithm's divide-and-conquer approach.  
   - Covers advantages, limitations, and how it improves on the naive approach.
